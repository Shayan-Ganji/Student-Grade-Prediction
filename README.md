# Student Grades Prediction Project

This repository contains the final project of the **Data Science in Python** course, held by the **Professional and Specialized Training Office** of the University of Tehran.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict students' final grades using various machine learning techniques. The project covers key stages of the data science workflow, including:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Combining highly correlated features and introducing new variables based on data insights.
- **Modeling**: Using machine learning models such as Lasso Regression, ElasticNet, and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation**: Applying K-Fold cross-validation and optimizing models using Grid Search.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle:

## Acknowledgment

Special thanks to **Dr. Mohsen Yazdinejad** for his guidance throughout the course.
